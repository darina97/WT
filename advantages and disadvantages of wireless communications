 ## Advantages and disadvantages of wireless communication

Advantages:
1. Mobility
The most remarkable feature of wireless communication is mobility. 
Electromagnetic waves that are used for wireless communication do need any medium to travel from one place to another.
Mobile phone is the perfect example of mobility provided by a wireless system.
While using a mobile phone, device mobility is not just limited to short distances but you can also move large distances,
for example, from one state or country to another.

2. Economical
Eliminating the need of physical conductor between two communicating devices, the cost that is associated with setting up,
planning and maintaining a network for communication can be reduced considerably.

3. Flexibility
Addition of a new device in a wired systemm might require a lot of cabling and modifications in an existing network structure.
Moreover, failure of a single component of a wired network can lead to impairment of the entire network.
For example, when a network is laid using ring topology, each device on the network is connected to two adjacent devices, thus 
forming a connected structure in the form of a circular ring. A message travels from one device to another before it can reach
its destination. In such a situation, the entire network will stop working even when a single device is not working properly.

4. Convenience
A wide range of wireless devices , such as mobile phones, laptops and PDAs are now available in different sizes as well
as specifications. It is convenient and easy to use these devices because connection to a wireless network is provided just 
at a button click. These devices are also portable and easy to carry along with you while you are traveling and need to
exchange data on the go
